On the web, I am often known as 'Edasaur'. I like things that work and look nice. Last summer (summer 2014), I interned at <a href="http://www.symantec.com/">Symantec</a> as a graduate student intern. While not programming or working on homework assignments, I can often be found playing badminton, practicing Wushu, or solving Rubik's cubes</p>

                                    .git is a system used for version control and collaboration on developing software. Version control allows for developers to easily rollback and keep track of changes, while collaboration allows them to work more efficiently in groups. I am moderately well-versed in .git and have been using it comfortably for the last couple of years along with Github. Click on the title for my github.

                                    Python is primariy a relatively high-level programming language that has an emphasis on code readability. Despite it's relative high level of abstraction, Python still scales, allowing developers to create anywhere from small scripts to large applications. I am relatively well-versed in Python, having used it in the last three years.

The original goal of the project was to convert sound recordings (whether it be wav or mp3) and convert it to sheet music. Upon embarking on this project, I realized that this project was a very difficult, as polyphonic transcription remains a research topic to this day. One of the main challenges is finding the pitches played within the audio file. However, if relatively successful with recognition of pitches, there is a wide variety of applications for this project.

Along with several graduate students, I developed a flexible price-tracking web application, generalized across multiple e-commerce platforms. Through the use of API calls and efficient web-crawling, our application kept track of prices on various Norton products on many different e-commerce platforms. One of the main take-aways from this project is the importance of optimization. This application is currently in use by Symantec's marketing team.

The goal of the project was to optimize a program that could perform image convolution. By using multi-threading, and optimizing cache performance, I was able to create a fairly efficient image edge-detector, edge-sharpening, embossing, and blurring tool. Due to course policy, however, I am unable to link to the code I wrote.
